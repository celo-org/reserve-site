title: Initial Reserve Target
---

The initial reserve targets the following allocation (based on protocol governance) over time. 
The initial CELO amount allocated to the reserve will be be diversified into other non-CELO currencies, the market fluctuates constantly and the reserve rebalances systematically, so the actual holdings will be off-target initially. Reserve trades are generally done on exchanges (following best execution principles), with some of the initial diversification trades being done OTC, with multi-year lock-ups on CELO sold.
